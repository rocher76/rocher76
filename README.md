- 👋 Hi, I’m @rocher76 from the Democratic Republic of Congo
- 👀 I’m interested in Javascript and related technologies. At a later stage I would love to explore other languages as well.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript (front-end and back-end).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... any project that would give me enough experience and confidence to be able to participate (why not start my own) in mega-projects.
- 📫 How to reach me ... via email at rocky.mbaya@gmail.com
